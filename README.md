"Mapty" is an interactive web project that leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and user-friendly map experience. The project utilizes the Leaflet.js library, a popular open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.

The main feature of Mapty is its ability to allow users to click on the map, triggering a pop-up interface. This interface empowers users to create personalized reminders associated with specific locations. Users can input details about the task or action to be performed on a particular day and set it as a reminder.

Once a reminder is created, Mapty visually represents it on the map by placing a marker at the corresponding location. This marker serves as a visual cue for users to easily identify and recall their planned activities
