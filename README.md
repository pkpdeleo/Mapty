# Mapty üó∫Ô∏è

Mapty is an interactive web application that allows users to create personalized reminders associated with specific locations on a map. Using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, along with the _Leaflet.js library_, Mapty offers a dynamic and user-friendly map experience.

# Features

- Interactive Map: Click anywhere on the map to create a new reminder.
- Custom Reminders: Input details about tasks or actions to be performed on specific days.
- Visual Markers: Markers are placed on the map to visually represent your reminders.

# Project Structure

The repository contains the following files:

1. index.html: The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the application.
2. style.css: The stylesheet for styling the application.
3. script.js: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for the map interaction and reminder functionality.
4. logo.png: The logo image used in the application.
5. icon.png: Icons used in the application.

# How It Works

- Map Interaction: Users can click on the map to add a reminder. The application uses the Leaflet.js library to handle map interactions.
- Reminder Creation: A pop-up interface allows users to enter details about the reminder.
- Visual Representation: Once a reminder is created, a marker is placed on the map at the location associated with the reminder.

# Customization

1. Modify Styles: Edit style.css to change the appearance of the application.
2. Update JavaScript: Modify script.js to adjust the map interactions or reminder functionality.
3. Change Assets: Replace logo.png and icon.png with your own images if needed.
